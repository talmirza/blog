      <description>As a techie and an aspiring data scientist, I&amp;rsquo;m spending a lot of time nowadays on learning data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence concepts, and working through some books and online courses. To help me solidify my understanding and have better retention, and to sharpen my writing skills, I thought it would be a good idea to have a personal blog where I can document, and hopefully showcase, my learnings.</description>
