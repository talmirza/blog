As a techie and an aspiring data scientist, I'm spending a lot of time nowadays on learning data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence concepts, and working through some books and online courses. To help me solidify my understanding and have better retention, and to sharpen my writing skills, I thought it would be a good idea to have a personal blog where I can document, and hopefully showcase, my learnings. 

A quick research introduced me to the concept of static websites and to one of two major platforms that can be used to develop one: Hugo (and the other one being Jekyll). Given my minimalistic blogging needs and taste, the Cocoa and Cocoa Enhanced themes seem to be perfect. So here I am, writing my first post on my blog, built using Hugo and its Cocoa-Enhanced theme.
